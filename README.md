# Hotwire POC

Since DHH's announcement of Hotwire, I was curious to know how the framework works and how it helps on the pace and quality of the code. This project aims to create a simple blog, adding features helpful to the learning path of this tools. Also, I haven't used Ruby on Rails before, so there are two challenges running here.

Feel free to create a [discussion](https://github.com/FRicardi/hotwire-poc/discussions/) on this repo, so we can grow this POC and learn together! 

## Setup
Here's a quick guide to setup this project on your machine.

1. Ruby on Rails

    Follow [Ruby on Rails getting started guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) steps to install Ruby, SQLite3, node.js, yarn and Rails installed on your machine.
2. Intall dependencies

    Run ```bundle install``` on the root of the project.
3. Start server

    Run ```rails server``` and our little blog should be up and running.
